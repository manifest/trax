class AcceleratedOptimizer(object):
  """Accelerates running an optimizer on a Trax layer returning a scalar loss.

  By default it uses all available accelerators, runs an accelerated version
  of the loss layer forward and then updates its weights using the optimizer.
  If only one accelerator is available, this JIT-compiles the underlying
  computation and in this way makes it run faster.

  We assume that the loss layer (usually model with loss) has already been
  initialized, but the optimizer will be initialized separately here.

  The output after running the `minimize` function is just the loss from the
  loss layer, but as a side effect it also updates the weights of the layer
  and the slots of the optimizer.
